        ðŸ‘‹ We&apos;re thrilled to have you try out our app! We wanted to let you
        know that it&apos;s currently in the alpha stage and open for limited
        public preview. This means that while we&apos;ve been hard at work the
        app&apos;s not quite finished yet and may still have some rough edges.
      </chakra.p>
      <chakra.p mt={4}>
        As you try out the app, we invite you to share your thoughts, feedback,
        and ideas with us. Your input will help us shape the final version of
        the app and make it even better! Expect a public roadmap to be released
        shortly.
      </chakra.p>
      <chakra.p mt={4}>
        During this preview period, no user data will be saved, so anything you
        enter into the app won&apos;t be stored permanently. Don&apos;t worry,
        though â€“ you can still play around with all the features and get a sense
        of what the app can do.
      </chakra.p>
